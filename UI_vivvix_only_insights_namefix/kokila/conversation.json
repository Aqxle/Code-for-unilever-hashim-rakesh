We will then compute the percentage share of the \"Radio\" media group's spend relative to the overall total spend.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in the `main` function:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef main(df):\n    # Calculate the overall total spend\n    total_spend = df['TOTAL $'].sum()\n    \n    # Calculate the total spend for the \"Radio\" media group\n    radio_spend = df[df['MEDIA GROUP'] == 'Radio']['TOTAL $'].sum()\n    \n    # Calculate the percentage share of Radio\n    radio_share_percent = (radio_spend / total_spend) * 100 if total_spend != 0 else 0\n    \n    # Prepare the result in a DataFrame\n    result = pd.DataFrame({\n        'Category': ['Total Spend', 'Radio Spend', 'Radio Share %'],\n        'Value': [total_spend, radio_spend, radio_share_percent],\n        'Description': ['Overall total spend across all media groups', \n                        'Total spend for Radio media group', \n                        'Percentage share of Radio spend in total spend']\n    })\n    \n    # Sort the result in descending order by Value\n    result = result.sort_values(by='Value', ascending=False)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Note: The actual function call and data loading should be done outside this function.\n# Example usage:\n# df = pd.read_csv('path_to_file.csv')\n# output = main(df)\n# print(output)\n```\n\nThis function will return a DataFrame with the overall total spend, the total spend for the \"Radio\" media group, and the percentage share of the \"Radio\" spend relative to the total. The results are sorted in descending order by the spend values."
