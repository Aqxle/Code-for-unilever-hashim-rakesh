Filter the data for entries where the `MEDIA GROUP` is \"Radio\".\n2. Sum the `TOTAL $` for all entries under \"Radio\".\n3. Filter the data further for entries where the `PARENT` is \"Procter & Gamble Co\" and the `MEDIA OWNER` is \"iHeartMedia Inc\".\n4. Sum the `TOTAL $` for these filtered entries.\n5. Calculate the percentage of Procter & Gamble Co's spend on iHeartMedia Inc as part of the total radio spend.\n\nLet's implement this in the `main` function.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef main(df):\n    # Filter data for Radio media group\n    radio_df = df[df['MEDIA GROUP'] == 'Radio']\n    \n    # Calculate total spend on Radio\n    total_radio_spend = radio_df['TOTAL $'].sum()\n    \n    # Filter data for Procter & Gamble Co on iHeartMedia Inc\n    pg_iheart_df = radio_df[(radio_df['PARENT'] == 'Procter & Gamble Co') & (radio_df['MEDIA OWNER'] == 'iHeartMedia Inc')]\n    \n    # Calculate total spend of Procter & Gamble Co on iHeartMedia Inc\n    pg_iheart_spend = pg_iheart_df['TOTAL $'].sum()\n    \n    # Calculate the percentage\n    if total_radio_spend > 0:\n        percentage_spend = (pg_iheart_spend / total_radio_spend) * 100\n    else:\n        percentage_spend = 0  # To handle division by zero if total_radio_spend is 0\n    \n    # Prepare the result DataFrame\n    result_df = pd.DataFrame({\n        'Category': ['Procter & Gamble Co spend on iHeartMedia Inc as % of total Radio'],\n        'Percentage': [percentage_spend],\n        'Media Group': ['Radio']\n    })\n    \n    return result_df\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assuming `df` is your DataFrame loaded from the CSV\n# result = main(df)\n# print(result)\n```\n\nThis function will return a DataFrame with the calculated percentage spend of Procter & Gamble Co on iHeartMedia Inc as part of the total spend on Radio."
